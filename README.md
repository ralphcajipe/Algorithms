# CS-Algorithms
Covers the different categories of algorithm design and analysis. These include brute-force, divide-and-conquer, decrease-and-conquer, transform-and-conquer, space and time tradeoffs and greedy algorithms. It will focus on general design and analysis techniques that underlie these algorithms.

Algorithms are judged not only by how well they solve a problem, but also by how effectively they use resources like time and space. This will show techniques for analyzing time and space complexity of algorithms and will use these to evaluate tradeoffs between different algorithms. This will also show that problems can be organized into a hierarchy that measures their inherent difficulty by the efficiency of the best possible algorithm for solving them.
