# CS-Algorithms
Covers the different categories of algorithm design and analysis. These include brute-force, divide-and-conquer, decrease-and-conquer, transform-and-conquer, space and time tradeoffs and greedy algorithms. It will focus on general design and analysis techniques that underlie these algorithms.
